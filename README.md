**What is creative computing?**

Using computing and technology to develop design or artistic projects. 

**Resaerching examples of creative computing.**

_Experiments with Google: Anchor_

Anchor is a chrome extension which adds an interface that helps tackle the addictive use of technology, specifically the act of 'scrolling' infinitely and losing track of time. The interface is a series of graphics that bring the viewers underwater, gradually turning your screen into an deep ocean blue and fish swimming across the page. It plays with the idea of diving under water, and eventually fitting 'rock bottom', putting a stop to the infinite scrolling as many algorithms are designed today to be addictive and will only encorage you to keep scrolling. 

_Experiments with Google: Morph_

Morph is an app that organises the home page of your phone to help you stay focused. It allows the user to personalise and assign apps under different categories: work, exercising, creativity, travelling, etc. Thus users will easily access the necessary apps and prevents other distractions on the phone. This is a very productivity focused design, and it targets the issue of addictive technology, or using apps at the right place and right time to maximise productivity when using technology.

**Experimenting with physcial computing**

In class, we worked briefly with the **Arduino kits**, building a simple circuit with a switch, resister and LED light.

For the rest of the week, I continued working with physical computing on **tinkerCAD**, building different circuits.

^ Circuit with LED bulb and resistor.

^ Circuit with Peizo: playing with sound.

^ Circuit with photoresistor: testing how the motor speed changes under simulated sunlight.

**Exploring further on TinkerCAD**

I tried more circuits on TinkerCAD that involve a bit of code. 

<img width="500" alt="Screen Shot 2021-11-23 at 2 38 35 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94919976/143082932-72c7b1ca-0821-4b81-83e9-3b1a50d0449a.png">

I used block code to programe the "animation speed" of the LED bulbs, allowing the three bulbs to light up at a set speed.

^ The text of the code blocks we created for our digital outputs.

Testing the circuit with RGB bulb and coding it to change colours in a repeating pattern.

After this test I was quite interested in the RGB bulb so I tried doing the code writing circuit project for making a colour mixing lamp.

This circuit involved a lot of coding to control all three photoresistors and change the colour of the RGB bulb accordingly.

I spent a long time on fixing the code and testing it, but at the end I still failed to get the lights to change colours. Even though my experimentation was not successful, through the process of writing and trying to run the code I was able to learn more about the basic structure of code.

**Reflection**

My week in exploring creative computing was very insightful. As someone who has no prior knowledge on this medium I learnt a lot more about what creative computing is and what it can be. Though I still worked with some of the most conventional things in computing (coding, circuits etc.) through resarch I was still able to look at how different designers use creative computing to create interesting projects, debunking my original impression of computing being boring and full of code. However though I have explored more about this field, I have to admit that I am still not too interested in creative computing. I acknolwedge that it is useful to have a basic understanding of computing and code to work with design but I think this field is not one that really suits me.
